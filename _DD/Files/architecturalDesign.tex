\subsection{Overview}
CKB is thought form the ground basis as a client-server platform. In fact, Users access services through a Web App, which consitutes the only virtual device able to receive commands to interact with CKB.\\\\
The main logic is hosted in servers, which job is to change the enviroment following Users' instructions, considering rules and practises set by CKB's developers and authors.
Educators and Students have different roles, prerogatives and privileges, as specified before and in grater detail in RASD Document. This is reflected in two different type of clients with respective commands and instructions for each kind of User.
Indeed both, considering even the fruition through Web App, can be thought as thin clients, witch role is just to expose to the User the Platform's services and their respective interfaces, deducting from the server exclusively the presentation of the App, meaning the GUI.
The approach empowers developers and authors to upgrade CKB with new functionalities without changing User's interface or all the way around, guaranteeing modularity and improvements.
Client's comunication is ideally handled by the Web Broswer that hosts the Web App. Using HTTP and TCP protocols it has to provide a secure and effective comunication with the Server. CKB User Interface code has to be written in order to be run on all kind of Broswers.\\\\
Servers, on the other hand, would be deputed to guard Users' data, after their kind and privileges, and Platform's model changed following given rules. Morevoer, they will manage and access interfaces provided by RMPs and E-mail providers, receiving their messages and instructions, acting conseguently, and using in turn their APIs to pull code or send E-mail respectively.\\\\
CKB, as thought, has at its core the possibility to manage and run multiple Battles, Tournaments and receive multiple inputs from different clients, after their type, all at the same time. Servers has to handle multiple requests, realizing it thought concurrency. An architectural approach that can be chosen is the Microservices one. 
With this choice, favored by the presence of multiple servers, each machine would host multiple components, properly replicated even in other computers, each one would elaborate specific inputs related to a precise topic or set of linked operations, that constitute a service.
The concept would include DBMS services, provided throught proper APIs, as long as Comunication ones and the dispatcher itself, that would account all requests form Users redirecting them to the right Microservice. This architeture guarantees concurrency, modularity, witch positively affects mantainance, and platform reactiveness.
All including appropritate duplication of each component to avoid failures and allowing the Platform to not lose data and determining resilience.\\\\
Ultimately CKB, once realized, would be a three layer platform:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Client Layer} Receves inputs form Users. It exists in two kinds, one for the Student and one for the Educator. It is built as a thin client, which role is just to run GUI.
    \item \textbf{Comunication layer} This layer is common, with proper differences, to Client and Server. In the first case, it controls in and out messages, allowing the Web App to comunicate with Server. In this case this part is ideally integrated in the Web Browser that runs CKB User interface. In Servers it is crucial for receing inputs and sending outputs to Clients, and handle controls form RMPs and E-mail providers.
    \item \textbf{Server Layer} Servers built with a Microservice approach, are able to manage multiple commands, instructions and answers to multiple Users. Its main roles are to preserve Data and change the Model according to inputs and Platform's rules.
\end{enumerate}
