\subsection{Overview}
%CLIENT-SERVER
CKB is conceptualized from the ground basis as a \textbf{Client-Server} platform. In fact, Users access services through a Web App, which constitutes the only virtual device able to receive commands to interact 
with CKB.

\\
The main logic is hosted in the server that manages all the functionalities of CKB, instead the client is only a graphic representation for the user.

Because the client, acting as a thin client, only displays the GUI to the user in order to expose the Platform's services and functionalities with their corresponding interfaces that it obtains by communicating with the Server through 
the Network, the client-server software organization that was chosen is \textbf{Remote Representation}.

The Web Browser hosting the Web App should ideally handle client communication. It must enable safe and efficient communication with the server via the HTTP and TCP protocols. 

To be used with all types of browsers, CKB User Interface code needs to be written. However, after their kind and privileges, servers would be assigned to protect users' data, and the platform's model would change in accordance 
with the guidelines.\\
\\
%MICROSERVICES
The fundamental capability of CKB is the ability to simultaneously manage and conduct multiple Battles, Tournaments, and receive multiple inputs from various clients, based on their type. 
The server must manage several requests at once, recognizing this through concurrency.

The \textbf{Microservices architectural} approach is one that can be selected. This option, which is supported by the availability of multiple servers, would allow each machine to host multiple service components that are properly 
replicated even in other machines. These components would each elaborate particular inputs pertaining to a particular topic or collection of related operations that make up a service.

The concept would include DBMS services, provided thought proper APIs, as long as communication ones and the dispatcher itself, that would account all requests from Users redirecting them to the 
right Microservice. This architecture guarantees concurrency, modularity, witch positively affects maintenance, and platform reactivity.

The method ensures modularity and improvements by enabling developers and authors to update CKB with new functionalities without altering the user interface in any way. It also allows the Platform to retain data and determine 
resilience while ensuring appropriate duplication of each component to prevent failures.\\

%LAYER
CKB is thought to be implemented as a \textbf{Three Layer Architecture}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$]
    \item \textbf{Presentation Layer:} this layer's only purpose is to display to the user the application's product functionalities through a graphical interface.
    \item \textbf{Application Layer:} this layer is the central component of the platform since it contains the entire application's logic and controls its functionalities.
    \item \textbf{Data Layer:} the application's whole data set is contained in this layer.
\end{enumerate}

%TIER
CKB, once realized, would be a \textbf{Four Tier Application}:
\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$]
    \item \textbf{Client} Receives inputs form Users, displaying answers from the Server, allowing to navigate and interact with the Platform. As a thin Client is equipped just with 
    communication APIs with the Server, that sends what is needed to exhibit GUI, and components to build this latest one. User visualizing interface consists in the proper Student and Educator 
    variant, which differences are only at this architectural level irrelevant for the system's functioning.
    \item \textbf{Web Server} Web Server is the main door to access the Platform itself. It counts the module deputed to communicate with clients, the firewalls, the DMZ and the interfaces to 
    expose access to the system. Web Server is directly connected with the Application Server, and it is uncharged of sending back information to clients to update the GUI, reflecting 
    modifications on the Platform itself. This tier constitutes the bridge between Students and Educators and CKB.
    \item \textbf{Application Server} Application Server is the Platform itself with its core functionalities. It is built with a Microservice approach, that consists of single software modules 
    that manages a single "service", a group of operations related to a specific topic. The structure is preceded by a dispatcher module, that redirects clients' requests to proper service. 
    A suitable distribution of the application server in microservices will allow managing multiple Users' interactions at the same time.
    \item \textbf{DBMS Server} CKB stores even Users'information and both data to run the Platform, like tournament's and battle's data. DBMS tier is deputed to store, ensure and manage those data, 
    allowing access to Microservices that would require them, updating if needed according to proper rules. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Component View}
CKB's Application Layer is based on Microservices, that consitutes components in the system's architeture.
Which are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{SignInManager} It is the manager encharged of allow Users to sign in into the Platform or sign out, throught proper interface.
    \item \textbf{LogInManager} This module is the access door to CKB's Platform. It memorizes all Users which are currently interacting with the system. The component exposes a logIn Interface used by the User to log in and by other components to verify if a existing User is, in fact, logged in. Finally the interface allows to log out too.
    \item \textbf{RMPManager} The manager allows the Platform to perform pull requests from corresponding repos, acting as a Client in face of RMP. It is used by Evaluation Manager witch acceses pullRequests Interface.
    \item \textbf{NotificationManager} This component manages particular notifications to be sent to Users, comunicating with E-mail provider, which performs as a Server for this module. Requests are sent on other components' indications, which are expressed throught sendNotification Interface.
    \item \textbf{EvaluationManager} It is encharged of running test cases for every code file submitted by each Team. Basing on given parameters it would assign the corresponding Score.
    \item \textbf{BadgeManager} Allows Educators to create a Badge with corresponding parameters anche criterias. Moreover it assigns Badges to Students who can be awarded.
    \item \textbf{BattleManager} This component, verified the identity of the User which accesses it, is responsable for invitations of other Students and traking battle's points thought proper interface. Finally the component allows Students to join the Battle.
    \item \textbf{TournamentManager} It will be used by Educators to create a Tournament and to invite other Educators to join it, throught provided interface. Furthermore this component exposes Tournament's information and repo to clone, updates ranking and allows Teams to participate.
    \item \textbf{AccountManager} It is encharged of recruiting all information about a single Account, allowing the owner to delete or update the Account with new personal data.
    \item \textbf{SearchManager} It performs all searches of Users and Tournaments within the Platform. It organizes the data in a proper way from results got by DBMS and makes them availble via its interface.
\end{enumerate}
