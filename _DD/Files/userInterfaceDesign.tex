In this section will be presented the user interface design of the application. The design will be presented both by means of diagrams and mockups. The diagrams will be presented in a top-down approach, starting from the main diagram and then going into the details of each sub diagram. After them will be shown the corresponding mockups. The scope of the diagrams is to give a schematic approach to see what pages shall show and allow users to do, while user interface mockups give a possible example on how components inside the diagrams can graphically be managed inside the webpage. Ultimately both complete each other describing user interface.\\
In the diagrams:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Big titled rectangles represent singular web pages
    \item Smaller rounded rectangles represent UI components
    \item Hexagons represent action performed after an event
    \item Circles represent events; for example a click on a button, or the ending of an action
\end{itemize} 
Colors are used to distinguish between different pages or actions, in order to render easier the understanding of the connection between them.\\
Since it is big and difficult to see, it has been subdivided in sub diagrams.

\subsection{Welcome, Log in and Sign in pages}
These pages are the once that a user or potential one sees when he/she first opens the application. Here he/she can choose to log in or sign in.\\

\subsection{Educator Homepage}
This page is the first page an Educator sees once logged in. Here he/she can see the list of Tournaments he created, search for a user, and check his profile. Moreover he/she can create a new Tournament by clicking on the "Create Tournament" button.\\

\subsection{Student Homepage}
Similarly to the Educator Homepage, the Student Homepage is the first page a Student sees once logged in. Here he/she can see the list of Tournaments he/she is subscribed to, search for a user, and check his/her profile. Moreover, the Student can see the list of available Tournaments with a specific search form, in which it is possible to search for a Tournament, and once selected one, see details and subscribe to it.\\

\subsection{Tournament Detail Page and Battle Detail Page}
Tournament detail page displayes information about a Tournament. It differs significantly between Student and Educator, and the number of available actions varies according to the state of the Tournament.\\
Also the Battle detail page is shown here, since Battles are strongly related to Tournaments. In the Battle detail page, if the user is an Educator, is also presented the form to add a score to the Battle of a specific Team.\\

\subsection{User Profile Page}
Pretty simple page where user profile data are shown and, in case of a Student, also his/her badges.\\

\subsection{Multiple device UI mockups}
The UI shall adapt to the screen size of the device it is being displayed on. Here are some mockups of how the UI will look on different devices.\\
