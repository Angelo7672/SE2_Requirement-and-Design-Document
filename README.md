# Requirement Specification and Design Document Project

This Project was part of the final examination of the course of "Software Engineering 2" of the Master in Computer Science and Engineering held at Politecnico di Milano (AY 2023-2024).

**Authors**: Angelo Attivissimo, Isaia Belardinelli, Carlo Chiodaroli

**Teacher**: Elisabetta Di Nitto

**Grade**: 13.25 of 14

**Officially**: R&DD Project of "Attivissimo Belardinelli Chiodaroli" group

The project consisted on applying skills gained during the course while writing the Requirement Specification and Analysis Document (RASD) and the Design Document (DD) of a fictitious platform (CodeKataBattle) before its development. After writing them, we had to show the main design aspects in a discussion with the professor.

Shortly, the Platform is called "CodeKataBattle" and is a place where educators can create tournaments in which groups of people can measure and improve their skills comparing their work with others, with the objective of creating the best piece of code in the tournament.
