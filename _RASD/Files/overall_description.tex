This section describes the perspective, functionalities, characteristics, and domain assumptions of CBK, which is a complete system.

A RMP is needed, but all the modules needed for its execution are available.
\\

\subsubsection{Repository Manager Platform}
The Repository Manager Platform is a platform that allows to store code in a smart way. Before listing the characteristics some basic glossary:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{VCS} Stands for Version Control System, a system that allows to save data in different versions keeping track of changes and authors.
    \item \textbf{Repository} A folder in which code is stored and managed by a version control system (VCS).
    \item \textbf{Action} code that gets executed by the RMP on the repository once a certain condition is met (i.e. new upload, time of the day, ect...).
    \item \textbf{Commit} Act in which changes are saved in the VCS. Commits have details consisting in a short textual description known as Message, and author data consisting in RMP handle and e-mail address.
    \item \textbf{Push} Act in which commits are uploaded to the RMP Platform.
    \item \textbf{Fork} Act of duplicating repositories created by others in a personal one
\end{enumerate}
RMP can be a first or third party system that is responsible for storing all Team code related to all battles of all tournaments, the code will be obtained only for test purposes and discarded shortly after score assignment. 
To be useful to the platform the RMP needs to have some necessary functionalities like:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item RMP users can search for other RMP users by handle or e-mail
    \item RMP users can collaborate on shared repositories
    \item RMP allows running actions and these can work with KCB platform's API, technically needed to signal the platform of new pushes on the repository.
    \item RMP has to 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Product Perspective}

\subsubsection{Scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$ \textbf{SC\arabic*:}]
    \item \textbf{Student signs in to the platform to participate to tournaments}\\ Alice is studying programming all by herself and wants to evaluate her work. She accesses the Platform website and is intrigued to try it out. 
    Alice signs in as a student giving her details like name, surname, e-mail,  year of birth and RMP handle. Once done that she will receive updates on new open tournaments. Moreover, she can log in and be presented with a list 
    of tournaments to which she can subscribe.
    \item \textbf{Student wants to participate in a tournament}\\ Dan, after studying a bit of Javascript wants to apply its studies in a project. In order to do so he wants to participate in a tournament. He is already subscribed 
    to the platform, so he can just log in to it and search a suitable tournament. After being presented of some valid choices, he clicks on one of them to see more details like description, educators, subscription deadline and 
    available badges. If he likes it, he clicks a "Subscribe" button, otherwise goes back and continues to search.
    \item \textbf{Student wants to participate to tournament with friends}\\ Bob, a user of the platform, got notified of the creation of an interesting tournament in which he wants to participate with his friend Carlo. Bob logs in 
    to the website and subscribes to the tournament sending an invitation to Carlo, who gets notified of the invitation and, once logged in to the platform, can choose to accept or to deny it; if he accepts Bob and Carlo result 
    subscribed to the tournament as a team.
    \item \textbf{Educator signs in to the platform to create tournaments}\\ Eve is a teacher that, in order to widen her didactic offer, wants to create some tournaments for her students. She accesses the Platform website and is 
    intrigued to use it. Eve signs in as an educator giving her details like name, surname, e-mail, year of birth, institution and RMP handle. Then she logs in and is presented with a list of managed tournaments, empty for her, 
    and the possibility to create new ones.
    \item \textbf{Educator wants to create a tournament}\\ Faith is a user of the platform signed in as an Educator and wants to create a tournament. She logs in to the website and is presented with the homepage, in which she can 
    start to create the tournament by clicking a specific button. After clicking it she can enter details like tournament name and details (as overview, programming language/s and maximum and minimum number of students for a team), 
    subscription deadline and badges, then click a "Create tournament" button that will create the tournament and bring her to the manager tournament page. 
    \item \textbf{Educator wants to manage a tournament with a colleague}\\ Grace is an educator who is managing a tournament, she finds that the work behind creating all battles of the tournament is a bit too daunting, so she wants 
    help. To do so she goes to the tournament management page and by clicking the "add Educator" button she can send an invitation to manage the tournament to her friend Heidi, another educator registered to the platform. Heidi 
    can accept the invite and create new battles for the tournament and if it is required, also manual evaluate the students' code.
    \item \textbf{Team wants to work on a battle}\\ After receiving notification of the tournament's start, a team that has subscribed to the competition wishes to focus on a battle. After arriving at the tournament page, to Isaac, 
    a member of the team, is shown a list of the battles that are available. He selects one and is taken to a new page that includes his name, details, the team scoreboard, and a link to the repository within the RMP. Since Isaac 
    has already registered with the RMP, he is able to fork the repository and make an actual copy that is stored in its profile. He now needs to check each team member's RMP handle in their profile and invite them all to join the 
    battle. All team members have to accept the invitation, and after then they can start to work on the battle. The owner of the forked repository has to put its link in the battle details to signal the platform of its existence and in
    other he has to set an automated workflow that informs the CBK platform (through proper API calls) as soon as someone of the team make a modification of the code in the repository.
    \item \textbf{Team wants to have work evaluated}\\ A team has worked on the battle and wants to check how is the quality of his work. In order to do so they only need to commit their changes and push their work to the RMP, 
    this will be able to alert the platform of the new changes and will set off a pull of the files to be evaluated. After running all tests, these will generate points that will be combined to form a score. This score will be 
    published near the name of the team in the leaderboard of the battle, and will update also the main tournament score of that team. Possible checks for badge assignment can be also done, and if satisfied, badges can be granted at 
    the end of the tournament.
    \item \textbf{Team wants to see how it is placed in the tournament}\\ Angelo, a student participating in a tournament in a team, wants to know how well they are doing. To do so he can log in to the platform and go to the page 
    of the tournament, on which he can see the leaderboard where he can find the overall tournament score of the team. Angelo can also check specific battles visiting their specific page where the related battle leaderboard is shown.
    \item \textbf{User wants to check out other user's profile}\\ Michael, a user of the platform, wants to find the profile of his friend Nick to check out on him. He logs in to the website in which he can search for other users 
    via a specific bar, there searches for Nick, and clicking on his name goes to the profile page. Here he can see his details like: user type, name, surname, RMP handle and badges.
    \item \textbf{Educator wants to create a Battle}\\Jude is an Educator who manages a Tournament. Now she wants to challange her Students proposing them a Battle. Opened the CKB Web App, in her profile she reaches the page with 
    the Tournaments she manages. Then, selected the one in which Jude wants to create a Battle, clicks on the "Create Battle" button. This brings her in a form to fill with the name of the Battle and the Students' RMP she wants to invite.
    Completed the form, she clicks on the "Submit" button. Now, verified all information by the system, the new Battle is created.
    \item \textbf{Educator wants to create a Badge}\\Beniamino is an Educator who wants to create a Badge for a Tournament he manages. Opend CKB's Web App, he accesses by his home page the one with the list of managed Tournaments.
    He selects the one for which he intended to create the Badge and clicks "Add Badge" button. A form is presented to Beniamino who fills it with an image, a description and the test script. Submitted the form, after the routine system checks, the Badge is created.

\subsection{Product Functions}
From the previous scenarios and the introduction above follow these Product Functions.

\subsubsection{User Functions}

\paragraph{Search for other user}
Every user subscribed to the platform, can search other users by name in the search bar. If the user searched is a student, on his profile page are shown also the badge achieved.

\subsubsection{Educator Functions}

\paragraph{Create a Tournament}
The page where the tournament creation is displayed is accessed by clicking a specific button on the homepage. 

There, educators can enter the tournament's name, description, programming language/s, minimum and maximum number of students per team, subscription deadline, and duration.\\ 
After the educator clicks the "Create tournament" button, students are notified that a new tournament is available.

When the deadline subscription is reached, the tournament begin.
\useSvgWithCaption{Images/BPMN/createTournament.svg}{1.0}{1.0}{BPMN diagram of the creation of a tournament}

\paragraph{Create a Battle}
In the dedicated manage page that is provided to the educators involved in a specific tournament, there is a "Create battle" button that an educator can use to create battles.

After that the educator click on that button, he inserts in the battle creation page the name, a description, the link to the RMP directory (the RMP directory contains all the test cases of the battle
and in some case also some programming code already available) and set how the battle will be evaluated, defining how many points of the total 100 will go to the functional tests, to timeliness, to 
the quality level of the sources, and optionally he could designate some points also to the manual evaluation. 

In any case the sum of the points that a team could achieve from all this parameter must be 100.

\paragraph{Add an educator to a tournament}
An educator can add another educator to a tournament once he is on the appropriate management tournament page. The educator's addition will support the manual assessment of the students' code.
\useSvgWithCaption{Images/BPMN/addEducator.svg}{1.0}{1.0}{BPMN diagram of the addition of a new educator to the tournament}

\paragraph{Create a badge}
The tournament management page allows an educator to make a badge. To accomplish this, he must click the "Create a badge" button. This will open a creation form, which the educator must fill out with the name of the badge and the rule 
or rules that the students must follow in order to receive the badge.
\useSvgWithCaption{Images/BPMN/createBadge.svg}{1.0}{1.0}{BPMN diagram of the creation of a badge}

\subsubsection{Student Functions}

\paragraph{Search and subscribe to a tournament}
A student can search for tournaments on the platform from his homepage. He can view the most recent tournaments added or search for them by name or programming language.

He can subscribe to a tournament after selecting one, and each tournament has a minimum and maximum number of students signed up for each team. While it is occasionally possible to compete alone, one of CKB's goals is to teach 
students how to write code in a team. As a result, students will most likely join a team when they subscribe to the tournament, and it's possible that he will invite some of his friends to join a team that he will name during the 
subscription process.

\paragraph{Accept an invitation from another student}
A student can join to a tournament by an invitation of another student and compete together in a team.

\paragraph{Complete a battle}
A student can finish battles by clicking on the button of a particular battle from the tournament page once he has subscribed to it. Once the RMP directory has been configured with the fork and workflow action, he can write code 
locally to pass the test cases that are included in the battle repository. The platform will automatically evaluate the functional test, the timeliness and quality of the sources, and it will update the battle score, that the student 
can view from the battle page, each time he pushes code into the repository. Optionally, an educator might evaluate the written code as well.

\subsection{User Characteristics}

\subsubsection{User}
A user is a normal person who intend to subscribe to CKB. It is able to access to the platform by web app from any type of device with an internet connection.

Every user subscribed to the platform is able to search for other users using the search bar.

\subsubsection{Educator}
An educator is a user whose job it is to provide students with rewards and practice materials for software development.

He designs coding battles and software development tournaments that simulate actual IT case problems for students. In addition, he evaluates their work optionally and creates a special badge for students who successfully complete 
specific tasks.

\subsubsection{Student}
A subscriber to CKB who wants to hone his skills in one or more programming languages or who wants to practice developing software in a team is identified as a student.

He can use the homepage to browse tournaments and subscribe to them, but he may also want to use the search bar to look up tournaments by name or just look them up by programming language. He has the option to invite other students
to join him in a team that he will name in the subscription, or he can accept invitations to participate in tournaments.

His team will be ranked in the tournament according to the total battle score they earn during the coding battle phase of the tournament.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Dependencies}

E' qui che dobbiamo parlare di RMP e dire che ci deve essere?

\subsubsection{Constraints}
\paragraph{Security Constraints}
Given her nature, this platform is more vulnerable to security attacks than other ones. For this reason, especially in battle code evaluation, the platform needs to implement state of the art security policies in order to protect user data and safety.
\paragraph{Privacy Polices}
Personal user data and storic user data shall be stored and used only for legitimate use internal to the platform. Public to the platform user data has to be accessible only via the platform. Finally, none of the user data has to be used for commercial purposes, and its use has to be done in compliance with, to the user, local privacy policies. 
\paragraph{Platform Limitations}
User is required to use internet connection to access the platform, download code repository and upload code for evaluation. Out of these actions, Users can work on battles locally without the need of internet connections, if not specifically stated otherwise in the battle description.\\
Battle computational size and complexity has to be sized in order to be feasible to be coded and executed locally by students.\\
Platform does not allow for live code editing and execution, for this reason users have to be able to edit and run code locally.
