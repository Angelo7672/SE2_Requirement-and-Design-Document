\setlength{\leftmargini}{5em} % default 2.5em
Being software development a subject based on technical skills and collaboration, CodeKataBattle is a platform that aims to help students improve their skills by training and competing in tournaments.\\
As hinted by the name, the inspiration for this platform comes from the world of Judo, where a "Kata" is an exercise, about some aspects of the sport, that gets repeated making little improvements at a time, with the goal to master it.\\ 
Students can use the platform to compare themselves to one another while gradually improving little by little.\\ 
Throughout the entire CodeKataBattle experience, students are under the guidance of educators. 
Educators organize and oversee competitions, and afterward, they grade and award students.
\subsection{Purpose}
The aim of the platform is to give a practical teaching to the students: they can improve their software development skills using their knowledge about one or
more programming languages to resolve puzzles about programming or developing an entire product from scratch.\\ 
In particular they will in competition one with the others following the schema of the "kata battle". This model, used by martial arts athletes, consists of repeating the exersice to constantly improve the result.\\ 
Students are encouraged to collaborate with each other in a way to improve also the collaboration skills. Finally their work is evaluated by automated processes within the platform or by educators and additionally, particular achievement named badges can be awarded to the most deserving students.\\
\\
The platform should provide two types of login for students and educators.\\
Students will have the possibility to partecipate to tournaments, possibily in teams, of code kata battle that are software developing challenges.\\ 
Instead educators will create tournaments and code kata battle for students and in addition they will define rules to obtaining badges that will be assigned to the students that will meet those requirements.\\
\\
The platform will evaluate the code written by the students by automatic revision such as test passed, time of execution, security and realiability. Additionally also the educators could partecipate to the evaluation process of a code
kata battle of a team of students.\\
\\
Code of all battles will be managed on a third party repository manager like "GitHub" or "GitLab", where Educators are able to upload battle code then students to modify it and the platform to run it.


\subsection{Goals}
\textbf{Platform Goals}
\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$ \textbf{GP\arabic*:}]
    \item \textbf{Allow Users to subscribe to the platform}\\In order to interact with the platform and its Users, Students and Educators have to be allowed to register. The satisfaction of this goal will concent them to be identified.
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to create tournaments}\\Battles are fought within a Tournament context, which is created by an Educator. So it is a goal of the platform to allow them in this. 
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to invite other educators to manage tournaments}\\Allowing Educators to invite other Educators will empower them to create Battles within the Tournament context. 
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to create battles}\\Both Educator that created the Tournament and the ones invited should be allowed to create Battles. 
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to define badges}\\Badges are created to gamify the platform and encourage Students to do their best. Educators are allowed to create Badges using different criterias.
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to score students}\\In order to make Students conscient about their work Educators are allowed to assign scores on top of the one defined by the platform itself.
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to get notificated about new tournaments}\\To concent Student to participate, they should be notified of new Tornaments created.
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to subscribe to the tournament}\\To participate to the platform and being scored Students have to fight in "kata battles", which are defined within Tournament context.
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to invite other Students to partecipate to a tournament}\\The purpose of the platform is to improve Students' coding skills. This is done even throught teams that Students have to be allowed to autonomously form. To do so, they should be able to search for other Students within the platform.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{User Goals}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$ \textbf{GU\arabic*:}]
        \item \textbf{Allow Users to do the login}\\Registered Users to be identified should be allowed to login in the platform.
        \item \textbf{Allow Users to search tournaments}\\Both Educators, to ask for access to Tournament in order to create Battles, and Students, to join them, Users should be allowed to search for Tournaments.
        \item \textbf{Allow Users to search for other users}\\To collaborate with other Users, they have to be allowed to search for others, both Educators, to share Tournaments accesses and create Battles within it, and Students, to invite others to a Battle.
    \end{enumerate}
\textbf{Student Goals}
\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$ \textbf{GS\arabic*:}]
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to compete each other}\\The principle behind the platform is to improve Students' skills, following "Kata Battle" mode. This implies Students to compete with each other on their own or in teams.
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to be rewarded for special achievement}\\Students should be allowed to receive scores for their work. In addition to this special achievements are rewarded, according to criteria decided by Educators.
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to form and work in team}\\To compete with each other Students can form teams. Working together they improve their collaboration skills.
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to have works evaluated}\\To be conscious of the quality of their work, Students have to be allowed to be have their work evaluated.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Educator Goals}
\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$ \textbf{GE\arabic*:}]
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to create Tournament}\\Battles are created within a Tournament context, which Educators are allowed to create.
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to create Code Kata Battle}\\Educators, both the one that created the Tournament and the ones who join it, should be allowed to create Battles, within Students will compete.
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to create Badges}\\To reward Students for special achievement, Educators should be allowed to create Badges.
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to evaluate Students}\\Scores, on top of the ones computed by the platform itself, can be assigned by the Educator.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Scope}
%An user should register to the platform as student or educator. The student see in his homepage the tournaments, his profile, and in other he has the possibility to search other users registered in the platform.
%The torunaments shown in the home page are described with a title and the programming language. 
%%In also the student can search other torunament in the platform. Clicking on a torunament, the student can see other details on that tournament: the deadline of inssubscription and
%the duration of the tournament, the minum and maximum number of student in a team for that torunament, the number of the battle composing the torunament. When he subscribe to a tournament, he has to soddisf the minum nuber pf the team so if he is the first component of the team subscribing to that 
%tournament he has to invite other student to the torunament if the minum number of student it is greater than one; the other student invited by the first one will register to the tournament by the invite.
%
The platform ought to enable students to take part in code kata battle tournaments, earning badges and scores that are split between the battle score for a single code kata battle and the tournament score, which is the total of all the 
battle scores.\\
The platform ought to enable students to sign up for tournaments and extend invitations to their peers to join them as a team.\\ 
Once a tournament has been created, teachers can use the platform to design code kata battles and give students specific badges for completing activities that meet certain requirements. Students who meet all of the requirements will 
receive badges from the platform, which will automatically check them. Additionally, the platform ought to permit the addition of additional educators to the tournament, in order to assist with the development of the code kata battles 
or the manual assessment of the student-written code.\\
Lastly, the platform should automatically assess the code that the students wrote and update the battle score; if an educator-performed manual evaluation is available, the platform should also take that into account when calculating the 
battle score.
