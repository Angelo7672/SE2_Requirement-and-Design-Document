\section{Introduction}
CodeKataBattle is a platform designed to helps students improve their software development skills by training and compete in tournaments against each other.
The student are supervised by Educators during the whole experience in CodeKataBattle: educators in fact are the supervisor of the platform, 
they create the code battle and the tournament.
\subsection{Purpose}
The aim of the platform is to give a practical teaching to the students: they can improve their software development skills using their knowledge about one or
more programming languages to resolve puzzles about programming or developing an entire product from scratch. In particular they will in competition one with the 
others following the schema of the "kata battle". This model, used by martial arts athletes, consists of repeating the exersice to constantly improve the result. 
Students are encouraged to collaborate with each other in a way to improve also the collaboration skills. Finally their work is evaluated by automated processes 
within the platform or by educators.
\subsubsection{Goals}
\textbf{Platform Goals}
\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$ \textbf{GP\arabic*:}]
    \item \textbf{Allow Users to subscribe to the platform}\\In order to interact with the platform and its Users, Students and Educators have to be allowed to register. The satisfaction of this goal will concent them to be identified.
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to create tournaments}\\Battles are fought within a Tournament context, which is created by an Educator. So it is a goal of the platform to allow them in this. 
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to invite other educators to manage tournaments}\\Allowing Educators to invite other Educators will empower them to create Battles within the Tournament context. 
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to create battles}\\Both Educator that created the Tournament and the ones invited should be allowed to create Battles. 
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to define badges}\\Badges are created to gamify the platform and encourage Students to do their best. Educators are allowed to create Badges using different criterias.
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to score students}\\In order to make Students conscient about their work Educators are allowed to assign scores on top of the one defined by the platform itself.
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to get notificated about new tournaments}\\To concent Student to participate, they should be notified of new Tornaments created.
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to subscribe to the tournament}\\To participate to the platform and being scored Students have to fight in "kata battles", which are defined within Tournament context.
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to invite other Students to partecipate to a tournament}\\The purpose of the platform is to improve Students' coding skills. This is done even throught teams that Students have to be allowed to autonomously form. To do so, they should be able to search for other Students within the platform.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{User Goals}
    \begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$ \textbf{GU\arabic*:}]
        \item \textbf{Allow Users to do the login}\\Registered Users to be identified should be allowed to login in the platform.
        \item \textbf{Allow Users to search tournaments}\\Both Educators, to ask for access to Tournament in order to create Battles, and Students, to join them, Users should be allowed to search for Tournaments.
        \item \textbf{Allow Users to search for other users}\\To collaborate with other Users, they have to be allowed to search for others, both Educators, to share Tournaments accesses and create Battles within it, and Students, to invite others to a Battle.
    \end{enumerate}
\textbf{Student Goals}
\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$ \textbf{GS\arabic*:}]
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to compete each other}\\The principle behind the platform is to improve Students' skills, following "Kata Battle" mode. This implies Students to compete with each other on their own or in teams.
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to be rewarded for special achievement}\\Students should be allowed to receive scores for their work. In addition to this special achievements are rewarded, according to criteria decided by Educators.
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to form and work in team}\\To compete with each other Students can form teams. Working together they improve their collaboration skills.
    \item \textbf{Allow Students to have works evaluated}\\To be conscious of the quality of their work, Students have to be allowed to be have their work evaluated.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Educator Goals}
\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$ \textbf{GE\arabic*:}]
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to create Tournament}\\Battles are created within a Tournament context, which Educators are allowed to create.
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to create Code Kata Battle}\\Educators, both the one that created the Tournament and the ones who join it, should be allowed to create Battles, within Students will compete.
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to create Badges}\\To reward Students for special achievement, Educators should be allowed to create Badges.
    \item \textbf{Allow Educators to evaluate Students}\\Scores, on top of the ones computed by the platform itself, can be assigned by the Educator.
\end{enumerate}
