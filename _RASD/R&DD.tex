\section{Introduction}
CodeKataBattle is a platform designed to helps students improve their software development skills by training and compete in tournaments against each other.
The student are supervised by Educators during the whole experience in CodeKataBattle: educators in fact are the supervisor of the platform, 
they create the code battle and the tournament.
\subsection{Purpose}
The aim of the platform is to give a practical teaching to the students: they can improve their software development skills using their knowledge about one or
more programming languages to resolve puzzles about programming or developing an entire product from scratch. In particular they will in competition one with the 
others following the schema of the "kata battle". This model, used by martial arts athletes, consists of repeating the exersice to constantly improve the result. 
Students are encouraged to collaborate with each other in a way to improve also the collaboration skills. Finally their work is evaluated by automated processes 
within the platform or by educators.
